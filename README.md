## Why Dream Server?

Setting up local AI usually means stitching together a dozen projects, debugging CUDA drivers, writing Docker configs, and hoping everything talks to each other. Dream Server replaces all of that with a single installer.

- **Run one command** — the installer detects your GPU, picks the right model for your hardware, generates secure credentials, and launches everything
- **Chat in under 2 minutes** — bootstrap mode starts a small model instantly while your full model downloads in the background
- **13 integrated services** — chat, agents, voice, workflows, search, RAG, image generation, and more, all pre-wired and working together
- **Fully moddable** — drop in a folder, run `dream enable`, done. Every service is an extension

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer/main/dream-server/get-dream-server.sh | bash
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and start chatting.

*The DREAMGATE installer handles everything — GPU detection, model selection, service orchestration.*

</div>

<details>
<summary><b>Manual install (Linux)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer/dream-server
./install.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS / Windows (coming soon — not yet functional)</b></summary>

Full runtime support for macOS and Windows is on the roadmap (see platform table above). The installers below currently run **preflight diagnostics only** — they will check your system but will not produce a working AI stack yet.

**macOS (Apple Silicon) — target mid-March 2026:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer/dream-server
./install.sh    # Runs preflight checks; full runtime coming soon
```

**Windows (PowerShell) — target end of March 2026:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer/main/install.ps1" -OutFile install.ps1
.\install.ps1    # Runs WSL2/Docker/GPU preflight checks; full runtime coming soon
```

For a working setup today, use Linux.

## Hardware Auto-Detection

The installer detects your GPU and picks the optimal model automatically. No manual configuration.

### NVIDIA

| VRAM | Model | Example GPUs |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 8–11 GB | Qwen 2.5 7B (Q4_K_M) | RTX 4060 Ti, RTX 3060 12GB |
| 12–20 GB | Qwen 2.5 14B (Q4_K_M) | RTX 3090, RTX 4080 |
| 20–40 GB | Qwen 2.5 32B (Q4_K_M) | RTX 4090, A6000 |
| 40+ GB | Qwen 2.5 72B (Q4_K_M) | A100, multi-GPU |
| 90+ GB | Qwen3 Coder Next 80B MoE | Multi-GPU A100/H100 |

### AMD Strix Halo (Unified Memory)

| Unified RAM | Model | Hardware |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| 64–89 GB | Qwen3 30B-A3B (30B MoE) | Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (64GB) |
| 90+ GB | Qwen3 Coder Next (80B MoE) | Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (96GB) |

Override tier selection: `./install.sh --tier 3`

## Bootstrap Mode

No staring at download bars. Dream Server uses bootstrap mode by default:

1. Downloads a tiny 1.5B model in under a minute
2. You start chatting immediately
3. The full model downloads in the background
4. Hot-swap to the full model when it's ready — zero downtime

<div align="center">

![Installer downloading modules](docs/images/installer-download.png)

*The installer pulls all services in parallel — "Take a break for ten minutes. I've got this."*

</div>

Skip bootstrap: `./install.sh --no-bootstrap`

---

## Extensibility

Dream Server is designed to be modded. Every service is an extension — a folder with a `manifest.yaml` and a `compose.yaml`. The dashboard, CLI, health checks, and compose stack all discover extensions automatically.

```
extensions/services/
  my-service/
    manifest.yaml      # Metadata: name, port, health endpoint, GPU backends
    compose.yaml       # Docker Compose fragment (auto-merged into the stack)
```

```bash
dream enable my-service     # Enable it
dream disable my-service    # Disable it
dream list                  # See everything
```

The installer itself is modular — 6 libraries and 13 phases, each in its own file. Want to add a hardware tier, swap a default model, or skip a phase? Edit one file.

## dream-cli

The `dream` CLI manages your entire stack:

```bash
dream status                # Health checks + GPU status
dream list                  # All services and their state
dream logs llm              # Tail logs (aliases: llm, stt, tts)
dream restart [service]     # Restart one or all services
dream start / stop          # Start or stop the stack

dream mode cloud            # Switch to cloud APIs via LiteLLM
dream mode local            # Switch back to local inference
dream mode hybrid           # Local primary, cloud fallback

dream model swap T3         # Switch to a different hardware tier
dream enable n8n            # Enable an extension
dream disable whisper       # Disable one

dream config show           # View .env (secrets masked)
dream preset save gaming    # Snapshot current config
dream preset load gaming    # Restore it
```
